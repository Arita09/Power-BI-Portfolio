# Financial Performance Analysis for XCompany
### **Project Overview**
**XCompany** has hired us to analyze their financial performance and provide actionable insights to improve **sales, profitability, and pricing strategy** across different regions and product categories.
We have categorized their key business questions into three groups and created **two reports in Power** BI to visualize and interpret the data effectively.

## Client‚Äôs Questions & Analysis

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sales & Revenue Analysis

* **Total Sales & Profit:**
  - The company generated $118.7 million in total net sales and $16.89 million in total profit during the available 15-month period.
Since we only have 15 months of data, we cannot definitively analyze seasonality. However, sales appear to increase every October, suggesting a possible seasonal trend.
  - Comparing Q4 2013 vs. Q4 2014, sales increased significantly except in November 2014, indicating overall growth.
* **Top Products & Categories:**
  - Paseo is the highest revenue-generating product, contributing $33 million, followed by VTT (~ $21M), Velo and Amarilla both (~ $18M).
  - Velo, despite their high revenue, have the lowest average profit margins (26.5%), making them less efficient in generating profit.
The most profitable product in terms of margin is Amarilla (15.86%), which should be prioritized for sales expansion.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Forecasting & Decision-Making

* **Sales Forecast:**

  - Sales have shown an upward trend, with revenue increasing every quarter.
    
  -  Based on historical trends, we estimate Q1 2015 sales to reach approximately $26 million.

  -  There is a potential seasonal pattern in Q4, where sales peak, suggesting targeted marketing and inventory planning may be essential during this period.

* **Profitability Growth Strategy:**

**To achieve a 10% increase in profitability, the company should focus on:**

  - Reevaluating or eliminating the Enterprise segment due to its negative profitability.

  -  Expanding sales efforts on high-margin products like Amarilla to boost overall profit.
  
  -  Strengthening marketing campaigns in high-revenue but low-profit regions (USA & Mexico) by promoting the most profitable products in those markets. Especially

  -  USA even though they are at 4th place in terms of profit with ($3M) they have sold a total 232,628 units.
Optimizing Q4 sales strategies as it is the busiest period so far, while introducing new promotions for Q3, which is comparatively weaker.

## **Final Recommendations**
‚úî **Reassess the Enterprise segment:** Either discontinue it or introduce new pricing and marketing strategies to improve its profitability.

‚úî **Prioritize high-margin products (e.g., Amarilla)** to optimize revenue and profit balance.

‚úî **Boost marketing and distribution in the USA & Mexico**, where revenue is lower but has growth potential.

‚úî **Leverage Q4 as the peak season and create strategic promotions for Q3** to balance sales throughout the year.

## **Conclusion**
XCompany has a strong financial foundation, but **profitability can be significantly improved with better product focus, regional sales strategies, and seasonal marketing efforts.** By **shifting focus toward high-margin products, adjusting pricing strategies, and leveraging seasonal demand**, the company can increase profitability and sustain long-term growth.
